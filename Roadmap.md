# Project Roadmap #

It is evident that Mobile technologies are the technologies of the future.

Assistance is required from the developer community to make this project stronger and also do bug fixes (when required). The product's source code is not thoroughly tested, and a through test and debug would be highly appreciated. However, I aim to get community assistance in:

  1. Helping in the development of and Android and iPhone library.
  1. Implementing a two way communication mechanism (Currently only Mobile->Web, we may have a standard protocol to have it mapped onto Web->Mobile.
  1. Migrate to other server side platforms (ASP.NET, PHP and Python).
  1. Contribute ideas on how we can grow the platform.
  1. Document the project.
  1. Implement it as a standard for Mobile and Web communications (grow it into a stable protocol).

The libraries are all free and there are no charges in distribution of the code / libraries.
